### What should the software do? A user can post a repository url to an server-url 
and post an discord webhook url to the server.  This should be stored in a database, 
most likely MongoDB, and activate each time someone commits a change  in the said repository.  

### Why? I couldn't find an easy way to do this so i decided to make my own solution.  
Also, I had an similar assignment for a cloud course, and want to learn  more with my own project.
